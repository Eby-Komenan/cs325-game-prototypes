<h2>Quick fire Simon</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
For this game, I added a twist to the original electronic game of Simon that requires players to press a button in the right sequence. The twist is the smaller time window and the fact that the game can also ask players to press any button except for the one specified.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Considering that this is my first phaser prototype, the fact that I was able to produce this game at all is the highlight.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned the overall behavior of phaser. For lack of time, I was unable to have the game issue commands multiple commands in one session.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All of the assets were borrowed.
<ul>
<li>Button spritesheet: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/buttons/action-on-click">Button</a></li>
<li>Background Image: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/buttons/action-on-click">Background Image</a></li>
<li>Failure sound: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/rhodesmas/sounds/342756/">Failure</a></li>
<li>Success sound: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/grunz/sounds/109662/">Success</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed code from <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/buttons/action-on-click">this</a> phaser example in order to register button  behaviors.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
None.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Mouse input, and randomly generated timer.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Time-based events.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Make the player have their reflexes challenged.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
As the game starts, the player waits for a command that can be issued 3 to 6 seconds after the game starts. The players then has a short window to obey that command (press one of the three buttons).
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Stay focused and wait for the command.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
There is litteraly no story.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players looking to be challenged by a fast-paced game that can throw curveballs.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
3- 8 seconds.
</li>

</ul>
